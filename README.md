# Simple-File-System

•	Written in C for a simple file system that can be mounted by the user under a directory in the user’s machine

•	On-disk data structures of the file system include a “super” block, the root directory, free block list and i-Node table.

•	Using i-Node to define a file or directory in the system

•	The idea comes from the UNIX file system

•	The designer needs to be creative to build the file system from a frame
